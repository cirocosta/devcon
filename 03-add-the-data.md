# Data Service

Every app needs it's data storage :) Our app will need one too. Fortunatelly, WeDeploy offers a no-sql data service out-of-the-box! You can simply install it and add it to your project with few clicks. So let's do that now.

Go to the project's page and click on a button to install a new service: **WeDeploy Data**.

Choose the name for the service: `db`. Click on the finall, install button and... just sit and relax. After few moments the data service will be up and ready.

The project's page looks like this now:
